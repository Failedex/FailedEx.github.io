    <p>So the other day, I had the idea of creating some sort of renderer using the eww widget system. Note that this is a very bad idea, and I do not recommend this project idea to anyone. My initial idea was to simply draw every pixel, which would probably end up looking cool and retro (maybe).</p>
    <p>This idea was short-lived as it completely broke eww, I ended up not being able to open my dotfiles.</p>

    <p>So what happened here? Well turns out my log file (located under <code>~/.cache/eww/</code>) was like 20GB. Removing the log file fixed eww.</p>
    <p>I'm still not fully sure what had happened, but I took this as a warning that I should not be using eww as a renderer, and I definitely should not be initializing 57600 boxes just to render some lines.</p>

    <p>Anyway, let's find a different way to create this renderer. Let's ask other equally insane people:</p>
    <img class="blogmediasmall" src="articles/3/media/helpme.png" alt="I ask for help">

    <p>Damn Aylur, why did you have to crush my dreams like that. Ok it's fine, Aylur did point us to a different starting point, boxes.</p>
    <p>As Aylur said, horizontal and vertical lines are possible using thin boxes. Unfortunately, boxes will strictly create horizontal and vertical lines. How do we draw lines of any angle?</p>

    <p>Simple, let's just rotate the line/box to our desired angle! (not simple, actually)</p>

    <h2>How to rotate something</h2>
    <p>Eww has a widget named <code>transform</code>, which allows you to rotate, scale, and translate things.</p>
    <p>"Oh hey <code>transfrom</code> allows you to rotate items! That was easy!"</p>
    <p>My brother in Christ you don't understand the pain I had to go through to utilize this widget. Here is a video of me trying to rotate potatoes</p>

    <video class="blogmedia" controls>
        <source src="articles/3/media/rotation.mp4" type="video/mp4">
        rotating potatoes
    </video>

    <p>What I got from this:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Rotation is not from the center, it from the top left (reasonable).</li>
        <li>Angles are not in degrees or radians, it is from 0 to 100.</li>
        <li><code>transform</code> tends to cut off parts of the children that isn't in the original box area (i.e. the rectangle of the potato image before it was transformed).</li>
        <li>Not shown in the video, but <code>transform</code> prioritizes translation over rotation. Translation will be done first.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>But there's more. Let's translate the potatoes to the top left, rotate it, and translate it back, essentially rotating the potato from the center.</p>

    </video>

    <p><strong>WHAT HAPPENED TO 3/4 OF MY POTATOES???</strong> I can't believe eww would betray me like this. My family will not make it through the winter.</p>
    <p>Thinking about it, this is expected. After translating the potato to the top left, you're only left with the bottom right corner of the potatoes. I ended up fixing this using negative margins, but this is painful to work with because you have to deal with a box with negative margins. There are many ways of coping with this. In this example, I centered the potatoes in an expanded box such that margin is irrelevant.</p>

    </video>

    <p>Truth be told, I have no idea how this works. This is usually a fuck around and find out project.</p>

    <h2>Ok, let's rotate a line</h2>
    <p>I didn't want to deal with the quirks of eww's top left pivot rotation fuckery, so I thought it might be easier to rotate each line by its center, though I wasn't sure if it actually was easier.</p>

    <p>That being said, here is the plan to draw a line.</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Calculate the center point, the length, and the angle of the line.</li>
        <li>Pass the information to eww.</li>
        <li>Move a square box to the desired location by abusing margins, center this box at the center of the line, and give it the same width as the line.</li>
        <li>Create a line in a square wrapper box in the square box and give it negative margins. Instead of rotating a box as thin as a line, we will rotate the wrapper square containing the line.</li>
        <li>Rotate the wrapper box with the line contained.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>You might be wondering why I'm rotating the square wrapper box instead of just the line. The simplest answer to this is that squares are much easier to rotate than rectangles. The more complicated answer is that simply rotating a very thin rectangle (the line) will cut off the line like how the potatoes was cut off, this is simply how <code>transform</code> rotation works. The best answer is that I don't know.</p>

    <p>You might also be wondering how I came up with such a foolproof plan before I started. Did I understand the inner mechanisms of eww so well that I was capable of coming up with the correct structure in my mind?</p>
    <p>No, I actually went into this project without a plan, fucked around, until I eventually got working code. <a href="https://github.com/Failedex/RendererOnEww/blob/main/eww.yuck">Here is the code by the way.</a> I refuse to explain it.</p>

    <p>Anyway, The result looks like this:</p>

        rotating a line.
    </video>

    <p>I've color coded the boxes such that red is the square box moved to the center of the line, and blue is the wrapper box which contains the line.</p>
    <p>Questions you might have:</p>
    <p>Q: <i>"Why is the wrapper box so much larger than the square box its in?"</i></p>
    <p>A: Because the wrapper box has a comically large negative margin value.</p>

    <p>Q: <i>"Why is there excess blue on the bottom right but not the top left side of the square box?"</i></p>
    <p>A: I have no idea. But it has something to do with how eww cut off the potatoes in the earlier example.</p>

    <p>Q: <i>"That's not red, that's purple</i></p>
    <p>A: The opacity of both boxes are set of 0.5, so its actally red and blue, which makes purple.</p>

    <p>After rotating the line by the right angle, we have successfully drawn a line from one point to another!</p>

    <h2>End</h2>
    <p>Now that we can draw a line from any one point to another, let's render a cube!</p>

    <p>And a donut!</p>

    </video>

    <p>Rendering this donut was when eww started reaching it's limits. I had to cut down on the lines and reduce the frame rate for it to run. It's clear that I can't really push this idea any further, so I'll stop for now.</p>

    <p>The code for this project can be found <a href="https://github.com/Failedex/RendererOnEww">here</a>. Thanks for reading my delve into insanity.</p>
