                        <h2>The ridiculous power of i3ipc</h2>

                        <p>i3 is fairly popular beginner window manager within the unixporn community a few years ago, but seemed to have died in popularity ever since Hyprland was released. It comes with a very sane ipc that does pretty much does everything you would expect it to do, like getting window information, workspace information, and configure stuff on the fly.</p>
                        <p>Last year, I was messing with the ipc when I noticed the ability to set window position and size. I didn't think much of it initially, but the following week, I realised that this was all you need to add animations to windows. To provide context, I was using sway at the time, which is just i3 but as a wayland compositor instead of an X11 window manager. While window animations are possible on i3 with the use of picom, animations on sway were hands down impossible at the time (and still technically is). However, animations are just a bunch of frames cleverly put together to create a smooth motion, so what's stopping me from creating those frames by adjusting the window size and position every 60hz?</p>

                        <p>Efficiency. This idea of setting the window position every 60hz is simply too absurd to be considered a viable option. Sway/i3 has a community capable of scripting, so if this was a good idea, someone would have already added animations to sway.</p>

                        <!-- <img class="blogmedia" src="./media/movecode.png" alt="Shitty code"> -->

                        <p>Unfortunately, I am notorious for my bad ideas, so I pushed this idea a bit further.</p>

                        <p>I started by stealing dwm's tiling system, since it was the simplest to copy, only requiring a stack system and some basic controls. In order to simulate the animations, I kept track of all the windows and moved them all simultanously per hertz, which is all kept under control at 60hz. To avoid conflicting animations, I had a global id that prevents 2 animations from running at once.</p>

                        <img class="blogmedia" src="./media/movemulti.png" alt="Shitty code">

                        <p>Needless to say, this is the worst snippet of code in the project. But if we can move our minds away from this section, the rest of the code is fairly decent. (lie)</p>

                        <p>Due to the hacky nature of this idea, there were multiple consequences that showed how ridiculous this idea was in the first place. The most notable being the fact that floating windows couldn't be used, since all windows were already floating in order to be animated. When I showcased this idea to the swayfx discord server, I remembered their disappointment as they slowly realised that the hell spawn I had created was a fake gimmick pseudo tiling hack rather than a proper tiling system.</p>
                        <p>Additionally, the complexity of the project scaled quickly. When I was adding workspaces, there were some random unpredictable bugs that I couldn't pinpoint. The aftermath was code spaghetti that I still can't comprehend to this day. Complexity of the project peaked when I tried adding workspace animations. I had to draw the line there and settle for normal workspaces as switching workspaces flickers the windows, making animations impossible.</p>

                        <p>This project was later released on my github as <strong>citsfsip</strong> (completely impractical tiling system for sway in particular), what followed was many other projects (from me) built on the idea of faking animations with i3ipc.</p>

                        <p>Side note: The naming of citsfsip was inspired by ncmpcpp, a software with an equally horrendous name.</p>

                        <p>Out of all my other project, this one was definitely the hackiest out of them all. In my defense however, it was poorly executed due to my lack of experience with i3ipc, and as one of my first projects with this ipc, I think I did a pretty good job!</p>

                        <h2>1 year later, January 2025</h2>

                        <p>Many people often wonder why I use swayfx over something objectively better like niri or Hyprland. The answer is simple, <s>I'm too lazy to switch</s> Hyprland is too popular, and niri's ipc has a long way to go.</p>
                        <p>As someone who likes making widgets, I understand the importance of a good ipc. It only makes sense that the communication between your widgets and window manager play a big part in making a functional desktop. Having a workspace indicator or dock sells the illusion that your window manager and shell is one of the same, which is a major reason why Awesomewm is a good window manager. Since I'm not on Awesomewm, I have to make use of what the ipc provides to create a sense of unity between my window manager and my shell.</p>

                        <p>As we all know, sway/i3 has a very sane ipc that does pretty much everything you would expect it to do. That alone was enough to keep me tethered to sway for the past 2 years. Niri on the other hand, was a new kid on the block, its ipc could barely hold a candle to sway's ipc. Despite this, I was quite a big fan of its unique scrollable tiling behaviour, mostly because it gave me many cool widget ideas. Unfortunately these cool widget ideas were not possible by the limitations of niri's ipc.</p>

                        <p>It was then I felt an urge I was rather familiar with, a forbidden whisper from deep within. It felt like there was devil on the right of my shoulder, but the angel on the left is long gone. I try to resist and stay rational, but the voices were only getting louder. The ideas were no longer being suggested, they were being narrated with a soundtrack.</p>
                        <p>That's when I knew I had no choice. I had to <i>do something stupid</i>.</p>

                        <p>The ideas weren't possible on niri, but they could be possible on sway. There's one big problem with this however... Sway isn't niri.</p>
                        <p>Or is it?</p>
                        <p>On 17th April 2024, discord user <code>brainless.bitch</code> tells me that I should rice niri; It was a good idea, but unfortunately, I had a better one. I started to write a new tiling system for sway, utilizing the same tricks used before from citsfsip. The plan was very simple, I was to mimic niri with sway, then claim that I had rice "niri", but in reality, I was still on i3.</p>

                        <p>Why? Idk, I thought it would be funny.</p>

                        <p>The vision quickly faded when I realized that I had no idea how to recreate niri's tiling system.</p>
