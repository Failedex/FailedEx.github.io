<h1>Just made a webpage.</h1>
<h3>14/5/2024</h3>

<p>Felt silly, might delete later.</p>
<p>Creating this website was actually very painful until I figured out what a flex box is. Then I became even more confused.</p>
<p>Regardless of the questionable process taken to create this site, I can officially say that I have created a website, and I am 100% fluent in HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript in my cv (I'm not at all fluent in HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript). </p>

<p>Since you're here, I'll introduce you to some facts about the website.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The icon for the webpage is a Petersen graph, which is a non-planar graph that does not contain K5 or K3,3.</li>
    <li>Click the skull icon on the top right if I'm losing your attention (this button has been removed sorry lol)</li>
    <li>The icon to the right of the skull icon is "tiling mode", commonly found in tiling window managers. After you press it, you should be able to move the windows around with left mouse button and scale the windows with the right.</li>
    <li>On "floating mode", you will see a downward arrow button, which will apply gravity to the windows. The windows can be thrown around.</li>
</ul>

<p>While I do not have much to say on this blog, I do plan to write other blogs (where I will have things to talk about) in the future. No guarantees though.</p>

<p>-Failed</p>
