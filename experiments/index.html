                        <h1>Remarks</h1>
                        <p>Ok, if you've never riced a desktop, you're probably really confused. I know what you're thinking, and I'll try my best to answer.</p>
                        
                        <hr>

                        <p>"Wtf are these pojects???"</p>
                        <p>So I like messing with my desktop environment, and getting it to do crazy things with whatever tools I can get my hands on. These projects consist of desktop environments, desktop games (games on your desktop), and general dumb things I've done with my desktop.</p>

                        <hr>

                        <p>What the hell is "eww" and "sway"???</p>
                        <p><a href="https://swaywm.org/">sway</a> is a compositor. I personally use <a href="https://github.com/WillPower3309/swayfx">swayfx</a>, which is a fork. I like to abuse it's ipc to make sway do things it's not supposed to do.</p>
                        <p><a href="https://github.com/elkowar/eww">Eww (Elkowar's wacky widget)</a> is a software used to create widgets for your linux desktops. It's configured in a weird lisp like language I like quite a lot.</p>

                        <hr>

                        <p>"Why aren't there any other projects? Is this all you can do?"</p>
                        <p>This section isn't really a showcase of all projects I've ever done, it's just desktop project. I've considered adding other projects, but it didn't really fit with the desktop experiments, so I didn't add them. Part of why I created this webpage was just to put all my desktop projects in one place.</p>

                        <hr>
                        <p>Once again, I want to reiterate that this website isn't a resume or professioal portfolio or anything (maybe one day it will be), it's purely made for fun and out of my own interest.</p>
